# Outage
Is a react practice project. Because everyone needs to know at least a little javascript.

Like all my practice projects there are a set of goals
#### Goals
* Should use reactjs
* Use some cool nosql database (maybe couchdb?)
* User should be able to create an outage form template
* User should be able to then create an outage form template
* User then should be able to search for current outages and their status

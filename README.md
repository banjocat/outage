# Outage
Is a react practice project. Because everyone needs to know at least a little javascript.

Like all my practice projects there are set of goals
#### Goals
* ~~Should use reactjs~~
* ~~Use some cool nosql database (maybe couchdb?) - Nah use mongodb~~
* User creation with mongodb
* User auth with ~~couchdb~~ mongodb and maybe nginx as well
* ~~User should be able to then create an outage~~
* ~~User then should be able to search for current outages and their status~~
* Use mesos to deploy
